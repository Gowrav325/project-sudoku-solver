# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver using the **backtracking algorithm**.

## Description

This project demonstrates how to solve a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle programmatically using recursion and backtracking. The algorithm attempts to place digits 1 through 9 in empty cells, backtracking when conflicts arise until a valid solution is found.

## Algorithm

The solver uses the classic **backtracking** approach:
- Start from the first empty cell.
- Try placing numbers 1 to 9.
- If a valid number is placed (doesn't violate Sudoku rules), move to the next cell.
- If no valid number can be placed, **backtrack** and try a different value in the previous cell.
- Repeat until the puzzle is solved or determined unsolvable.
